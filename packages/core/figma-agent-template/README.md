# Figma Plugin Template

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for integrating Codex-generated code with the Figma Write API.

- `manifest.json` defines the plugin metadata.
- `code.js` is executed when the plugin runs.

Codex can export animations as Lottie or MCP-ready data to be injected via this plugin.
